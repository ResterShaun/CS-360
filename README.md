•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goals of the app were allowing users to login/create accounts, creating a DB that holds information, a greed screen for items, as well as permission for notifications. The user needs this app was established to appease was a simplistic inventory app for warehouses/stores to utilize. They need to be allowed to login with unique accounts they create, add/manage a grid view of inventory items the location has to offer, accept sms notifications, and establish a DB to store all the information needed separately for each user.

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I established screens for login, registration, item inventory, adding items, managing items, and for if a user forgot password. I needed to establish functional buttons for each step as well. Since the app was designated for basic item inventory I chose to go a simplistic route. Utilizing blues for throughout since it is easier on the eyes than pure white vibrant screens on every page. I feel like my design accomplished each aspect of the project in a simplistic manner, no flooding of unnecessary information concise and to the point so my users can get straight to work.

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The main focal point for coding was concision and reusability. By keeping buttons and layouts similar from page to page for flow it allowed me to recycle a good portion of the code to streamline the creation of my app. Reusability and concision will forever be a must in the coding world I feel.

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

With this being the first complete app I have created I tested for errors every few lines as well as running the emulator after every screen completion to verify the screen was functioning correctly before moving on to the next phase.

•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

During the initial layout phase I was in the process of moving on top of the entire house succumbing to covid. So when I began the coding phase for the app I had tons of features I wanted to add during layout phase that I could finally start processing and implementing. I had to use the bland unfinished layout I submitted to keep the same theme/color I was focusing on in the initial design since those were the main thing I was happy with from initial layout.

•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I feel that I learned to properly manage mixing in the different types of layouts from linear to constraint I learned to properly implement them which I struggled with during the initial layout phase. The project as a whole taught me tons of steps with this being my first full app creation, in the future I will be able to implement every thing I have learned in this class.
